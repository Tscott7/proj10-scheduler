## Program Description:

This is a web application that allows the user to create a meeting within a set of times and dates, and connect their google calendar to it so that it can calculate their free times on it. Then, the user can send the ID to other users (there is no email option in the application itself) who can then attach their google calendars to it and calculate everyone's free times, thus giving them potential meeting times and dates. The application will detect if you try to create a meeting with the same ID as someone else, and it can detect if an invited user enters a meeting that doesn't exist.
